AimTo is an Android app that will help to make you more efficient.
It has 4 module:
1 Aim:
	Before you do anything, you should set up your goal which will be achieved some time (maybe 2 month) later. After you set the deadline, AimTo will count down the days left for you.

2 Task:
	Aims won't ensure you can get the destination. You should make detail plans and carry out these plays on time. You wirte down your plans and set notification time on the module Task, and then just get ready to do what you plan to.

3 Note:
	I encourage users to take note (diary) everyday. Self-respection and recording are important for that they make you gain experience from failure and success. When you look back, you will be happy to see your footprint.

4 Chart:
	You can score youself (from 1 to 5) each time you take a note, then the score will be drawn on the chart to show your state. The chart is useful if you record yourself everyday and you will sure to notice that your state will appear to be periodic, so that you can have a rest when your state is low and work hard when you mood is high.

It has a brief help (in Chinese) on the top-left.


AimTo is cooperated by my friend Xiaojia Ye (yxj@software.nju.edu.cn) who made the Chart module.
